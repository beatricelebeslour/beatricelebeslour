Hi, I’m Béatrice Lebeslour. I live in France and often travel across Europe, especially to Italy.

Outside of work, I care for plants and write about how to understand and support their growth.  
I also love comics, especially graphic novels like *Moi, ce que j’aime, c’est les monstres*, and how storytelling shapes our perception of everyday life.

I use this space to gather personal notes, digital fragments, and small observations.  
I’m not a developer, but I appreciate the clarity of GitHub and the idea of tracing one’s path, even when it’s nonlinear.
